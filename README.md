# Enterprise React in 2018 - 2019

This is the React stack you need to build a scalable reliable and nice looking SPA you will be proud of.
Read more about this example in my article on [medium](https://medium.com/@viacheslavlushchinskiy/enterprise-react-in-2018-2019-ae6c80c03f1).

## Motivation
React ecosystem is changing rapidly as well as the whole frontend development area. Compared to the previous years, developers tend to focus more on the business functionality rather than on tweaking webpack and CSS. 

I have created a tech stack which in my opinion is a minimum you need to build the modern enterprise frontend app in React.


You may also read the accompanying article to make the first step into the 'real world' of React frontend development. Even though there is always an alternative aproach to every piece of the React applications, you may rest assured that by using this stack you will look professional and you will be able to build the app of any reasonable size.
## Installation and Usage
* install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
* in local project directory run `yarn` to load modules.
* run `yarn start` to start the app.
* run `yarn run build` to build a production app.

You can see this app in action on github pages [here](https://slava-lu.github.io/enterprise-react/).
